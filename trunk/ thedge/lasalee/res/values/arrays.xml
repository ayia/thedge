        <item>"You'll be required to work out three times per week. We find that Monday, Wednesday, and Friday works well and allows you to use the weekend for rest and recovery before moving on to the next stage of the program. Feel free to juggle the plan around to meet your busy schedule, but make sure you rest in between workout days.

Don't cut any corners, but feel free to take a little more rest between each level if you need to. It's also important to be well hydrated before you start each workout."</item>
        <item>"Week 1 should now be comfortably behind you and it's time to start Week 2.

At the end of Week 2 it will be time to check your strength and perform an exhaustion test. In simple terms, perform as many good-form push-ups as you can comfortably manage before you physically can't do another rep. Stress your system by all means, but please don't go beyond the safety limit. The number of push-ups you complete will determine which level of the program you'll start in Week 3. Perform this test within 24â€“48 hours of completing Week 2. As a general rule of thumb, if you're working out on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, a good time to take the test is on Saturday afternoon. This allows enough recovery time from the Friday workout, but also gives you plenty of rest before starting the next stage of the plan on Monday. Good luck!"</item>
        <item>"You should be a little stronger than you were a couple of weeks ago and able to complete considerably more push-ups than your initial test.

If you're struggling with the program, don't lose heart. Some people will still be doing less than 16 consecutive push-ups, but this is ok. Just repeat the week you struggled with until you're strong enough to move on to the next level â€“ We promise it will be worth your while!"</item>
        <item>"Week 3 is now comfortably behind you and it's time to start Week 4.

At the end of Week 4 it will be time to perform another exhaustion test. You should know what to do by now â€“ simply perform as many goodâ€“form push-ups as you can comfortably manage before you're unable to perform another one. Stress your system by all means, but please don't go beyond the safety limit.

The number of push-ups you complete will determine which level of the program you'll start in Week 5. Make sure you perform this test within 24â€“48 hours of completing Week 4."</item>
